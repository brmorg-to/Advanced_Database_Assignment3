1.	The home page of the Brewbean's Web site has an option for members to log on with their IDs and passwords.
Develop a procedure named MEMBER_CK_SP that accepts the ID and password as inputs, checks whether they make up a valid logon,
and returns the member name and cookie value. The name should be returned as a single text string containing the first and last name.
The head developer wants the number of parameters minimized so that the same parameter is used to accept the password and return the name value.
Also, if the user doesn't enter a valid username and password, return the value INVALID in a parameter named p_check.
Test the procedure using a valid logon first, with the username rat55 and password kile. Then try it with an invalid logon by changing the username to rat.

The procedure needs to accept two values as input: a payment amount and a pledge ID. Based on these inputs,

If it isn't, a custom Oracle error using error number 20050 and the message "Incorrect payment amount - planned payment = ??" should be raised.
The ?? should be replaced by the correct payment amount. The database query in the procedure should be formulated so that no rows are returned
if the pledge isn'ton a monthly payment plan or the pledge isn't found. If the query returns no rows, the procedure should display the message
"No payment information." Test the procedure with the pledge ID 104 and the payment amount $25. Then test with the same pledge ID but the
payment amount $20.Finally,test the procedure with a pledge ID for a pledge that doesn't have monthly payments associated with it.

to make report generation simpler and more efficient. They want to schedule some jobs to run nightly
to update summary tables. Create two procedures to update the following tables(assuming that existing
data in the tables is deleted before these procedures run):

Create the PROD_SALES_SUM_SP procedure to update the BB_PROD_SALES
table, which holds total sales dollars and total sales quantity by product ID, month,
and year. The order date should be used for the month and year information.
Create the SHOP_SALES_SUM_SP procedure to update the BB_SHOP_SALES
table, which holds total dollar sales by shopper ID. The total should include only
product amountsâ€”no shipping or tax amounts.
The BB_SHOP_SALES and BB_PROD_SALES tables have already been created. Use the
DESCRIBE command to review their table structures. Run pl/sql block to execute and present results for both procedures.
